##Roster Bots

### Finished Product First:
[Roster Bots by Shannon Rivers](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/senbenito/roster-bots/blob/master/index.html)

Each player bot needs a name, and has three attribute scores associated with each:
  * __Speed__
  * __Strength__
  * __Agility__

The total sum of the speed, strength, and agility attributes is calculated as the "total attribute score" for each player bot.
The league has mandated that the total attribute score of each of your player bots can not exceed 100 points, and no two players can have the same score, otherwise your team is disqualified from league play.
The league has also implemented a salary cap. Each team's roster can not exceed 175 points.

#### Please generate an algorithm that can name your player bots and generates each attribute accordingly, as well as meeting the specifications of the league.


Please note the following:
  * Each player bot created must have a unique name.
  * Each player bot must have an alphanumeric sequence that looks like the following: "ABC1234" (as an example).
  * No two player bots can have the same name.
  * No two player bots can have the same total attribute score (speed + strength + agility = total attribute score).
  * You may use any sorting algorithm to define your 10 starter bots and 5 substitue bots.

Impress us with:
  * Well written tests.
  * A well documented project that describes your best practices.
  * A well structured front-end experience (optional).

>Please note: that the above are not requirements, but will help us determine your level of experience with the language(s) and tooling you provided.
