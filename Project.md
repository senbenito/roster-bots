##Roster Bots algorithm

####Understanding the Question:
Given the [assignment specifications](./README.md) from [Griffin DePriest @ Blue Star](mailto:griffin.depriest@bluestarsports.com), following is an outline of a possible Roster Bots solution algorithm:

1. We need to create a function that will create a robot `Player` consisting of five attributes:
  1. `.name`: _unique_, 7-characters (3 letters, 4 numbers)
  2. `.speed`: 0-100
  3. `.strength`: 0-100
  4. `.agility`: 0-100
  5. Total Attribute Score (`.TAS` = Sp + St + Ag): <= 100

2. These players will be used by another function to make up a `Roster` that:
  1. contains 15 `Player`s
  2. all _unique_ `Player.TAS`
  3. `Roster` aggregate `TAS` <= 175
  4. can be sorted using any sorting algorithm

####Devising a Plan
Thinking about this `Roster`, it seems like we could have a spectrum of talent running
  - from a relatively balanced team where each of the 15 `Player`s receives an equal share of the total `Roster` points (175)
  - to a 'star-player' team where a few of the `Player`s receive a majority of the points with the remainder essentially 'filling out the `Roster`'

>**Let's give the Owner a choice!**

>We'll create a `makeRoster(starNumber)` function that takes an integer allowing the Owner to concentrate points on a specified number of players (1 ... 15)

Which brings us to our `Player`s... each will have a share of the aggregate Total Attribute Score (`aTAS`), designated by the Owner pardigm (`starNumber`), to determine its unique Total Attribute Score (`uTAS`), so we'll use that algorithmically generated `uTAS` to portion out the `speed`, `strength` and `agility` attribute scores.

And, since the `uTAS` is by definition unique, we can use this number as a portion of the `Player.name` ensuring the `Player.name` is unique - _BOOM_!

>**Polymorphism at Play**

>We can reuse the same `makePlayer()` function that takes an argument `uTAS` generated by the `makeRoster()` function that itself can be reused by supplying a different `starNumber` argument to determine the `Roster` attribute points distribution paradigm.

####Code a Solution
It seems like we have a good understanding of the task at hand as well as how we'll approach building our `Roster` so let's look at these functions we'll need:
1. `makeRoster(starNumber)`:
  + Input (**integer**): `starNumber` determines attribute point concentration
  + Output (**object**): fifteen _unique_ `uTAS` variables
  + Approach:
    1. subtract `starNumber` from 15 = `bench`
    2. use accumulator pattern: **object.uTAS = 0-`bench-1` points**;
    3. divide remaining points across `starNumber`:  **object.uTAS = math.Floor(remaining points / starNumber)**
2. `makePlayer(uTAS)`:
